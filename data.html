    <h2>Data</h2>
    <p>Many cities now use software to manage incidents from 911, police, and fire departments. These are many industry buzzwords for these kinds of systems, including “emergency management systems” and “computer-aided dispatch”.</p>
    <p>Many of these systems require dispatchers or responders to code each incident by type. When the city has a code specifically for homeless camp fires, as distinct from other kinds of fires, that can create useful data. You might be able to get that data from city through a public-records request.</p>
    <p>For example, <a href="https://oaklandca.nextrequest.com/requests/21-4820">here's the online record for a records request of homeless camp fire incident data in Oakland, California</a>. That data could then be <a href="https://writing.kemitchell.com/2021/06/11/Oakland-Homeless-Camp-Fires">mapped out to show “hotspots” where lots of camp fires had happened</a>.</p>
