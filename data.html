    <h2>Data</h2>
    <h3>Public Data on Camp Fires</h3>
    <p>Many cities and counties now use software to manage incidents from 911, police, and fire departments. These are many industry buzzwords for these kinds of systems, including “emergency management systems” and “computer-aided dispatch”. Local police and firefighters will be very familiar with their jurisdiction’s system.</p>
    <p>Many of these systems require dispatchers or responders to code each incident by type. When the city has a code specifically for homeless camp fires, as distinct from other kinds of fires, that can create useful data. You might be able to get that data from city through a public-records request.</p>
    <p>For example, <a href="https://oaklandca.nextrequest.com/requests/21-4820">here's the online record for a records request of homeless camp fire incident data in Oakland, California</a>. That data could then be <a href="https://writing.kemitchell.com/2021/06/11/Oakland-Homeless-Camp-Fires">analyzed</a> to map out “hotspots” in the city and confirm intuitions about how often fires happen during different times of the year.</p>
