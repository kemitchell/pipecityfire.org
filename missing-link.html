    <h2>The Missing Link</h2>
    <p>Fire-focused homeless and refugee advocates often muse that they should be in touch, but aren’t. Both communities know there’s a lot they don’t know. Both communities face needs in excess of their resources. But there’s little sharing or networking to show for it.</p>
    <p>If you’re also interested in connecting homeless and refugee advocates on the fire issue, <a href="mailto:kyle@kemitchell.com?subject=Pipe%20City%20Missing%20Link">send an e-mail to kyle@pipecityfire.org</a>.</p>
